          W3Develops also helps anyone who is just getting started with learning to programming to get access to high quality free online courses that teach students to code. Some courses we give you such as freeCodeCamp partners them with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">nonprofit organizations</a> to provide a way for you to further hone, develop, and contribute the skills you gain to a mutually beneficial cause. You will be able to put the experience you gain on your resume and the non-profit will be able to use the code you contribute to help more people not as fortunate as us.

          Furthermore W3Develops connects developers to  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">resources and documentation</a> for learning Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and many more, as well as references, tutorials, developer guides, and much more.

          Build something. To make this a strong website we need strong members, and we will only ever be as good as the people around us, so take a moment and reflect and know you can do better and you will do better, so long as you try.
